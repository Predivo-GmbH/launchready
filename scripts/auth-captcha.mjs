/**
 * auth-captcha.mjs — read and flip LaunchReady's Supabase Auth CAPTCHA switch, without ever
 * rendering a secret.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * Closing the unauthenticated sign-in-email hole has two halves, and only one of them is code.
 * Half 1 — a Cloudflare Turnstile token threaded through every captcha-protected auth entry point
 * in src/components/auth/AuthModal.tsx — ships with the deploy. Half 2 is NOT code and NOT a
 * deploy: it is one project-wide GoTrue setting (`security_captcha_enabled` + provider + secret).
 * On ReplyFlow that half sat undone behind a green deploy for four days while the board row read
 * "shipped", because nothing in the repo could touch it. A setting only a human can reach through
 * a dashboard is a setting that rots. This is how LaunchReady's gets flipped, read back and rolled
 * back, on the record, by CI, with no secret rendered anywhere.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 *   report   GET  /v1/projects/{ref}/config/auth and print ONLY booleans, names and value SHAPES
 *   enable   verify the secret against Cloudflare, then PATCH captcha on with provider=turnstile
 *   disable  PATCH captcha off — the rollback, instant and total
 *
 * THE SECRET IS NEVER LOOKED AT. It comes from $TURNSTILE_SECRET and is piped straight into the
 * PATCH body. It is never printed, never written to disk, never put on a command line and never
 * put in an error message. What IS printed about it is its length and character classes — the
 * safe-inspect contract — and, from Cloudflare, a verdict about whether it is the right one.
 *
 * WHY `enable` CALLS CLOUDFLARE FIRST, AND WHY THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT
 * A WRONG secret is indistinguishable from a right one by every check that does not leave the
 * building: it is a non-empty string of the correct shape, `gh secret list` shows it, and the
 * PATCH succeeds. GoTrue would then reject EVERY real sign-in with a captcha error while the
 * switch reads healthy — a total customer lockout that looks exactly like a successful rollout.
 * Cloudflare's siteverify distinguishes them for free and without rendering anything:
 *     wrong/empty secret -> error-codes ["invalid-input-secret"]
 *     correct secret     -> error-codes ["invalid-input-response"]  (our dummy token is bad, as intended)
 * So `enable` refuses to touch Supabase unless Cloudflare has confirmed the secret is real. This is
 * the check that was missing when a dead sitekey would have locked ReplyFlow's customers out while
 * every monitor stayed green.
 *
 * ORDER MATTERS AND IT IS NOT NEGOTIABLE. Enabling captcha is PROJECT-WIDE: GoTrue then demands a
 * token on /token (password login), /otp (login + signup) and /recover. Enable it before the client
 * half is live on that project and every real sign-in on that project breaks. Prove the client half
 * first — the deploy workflows now assert the site key is actually inlined in the shipped bundle.
 *
 * STAGING IS DELIBERATELY NOT ENABLED. One captcha secret per Supabase project, so there is no
 * "test key" that could be scoped to staging alone. See the rationale carried in
 * supabase/functions/_shared/signin-captcha.prod.test.mjs (`whyNotEnforced`), which is the file
 * that will fail if anyone flips staging on behind our back.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/auth-captcha.mjs report  --project production
 *   node scripts/auth-captcha.mjs enable  --project production
 *   node scripts/auth-captcha.mjs disable --project production
